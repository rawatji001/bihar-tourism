            <h2>History of Bihar</h2>
            <p class="text">
              Two of India’s most glorious dynasties, Mauryas(321 -185 BCE) and
              Guptas (320 to 550 CE) flourished in ancient Bihar region, which
              was then known as Magadh. The Great King Ashoka (born 304 BCE,
              died 232 BCE) of Mauryan dynasty whose empire spread across South
              Asia. He had his capital in Pataliputra that is present Patna. The
              Gupta period termed as India’s golden age was also based in Magadh
              and Pataliputra as its capital.

            <p class="text">
              Nalanda and Vikramshila were centres of learning established in
              the 5th and 8th century respectively in Bihar, and are regarded
              amongst the oldest and international universities, where students
              from across the world came to study. It is in Bihar that the
              world’s first democracy was in governance by the Lichchavi(the
              present Vaishali).

            <p class="text">
              The great spiritual way of Buddhism originated and thrived in
              ancient Bihar, as Buddha attained his enlightenment in Bodh gaya.
              Therefore the region is full of remains of the monasteries known
              as Stupa. Jain leader Mahavira also belonged to this region and
              attained his Nirvana at Pawapuri. Among Hindu religious places
              Bihar has one of the most prominent pilgrimages at Gaya for
              imparting offerings to ancestors. Ramayana and Mahabharata, the
              grand epics of India which are still extremely popular and
              connected to Hindu religion have numerous tales associated with
              various places in Bihar. The author of Ramayana, Valmiki also
              belonged to this region.

              Bihar had also been a hub for the development of Sufism as quite a
              few of Sufi saints who initiated brotherhood among Hindu and
              Muslims settled here around the Islamic period. Imam Taj Faqih
              from Maner, Shihabuddin Pir, Jagiot are few Islamic saints amongst
              the many. The Qadri order, which is now believed to be one of the
              chief Sufi orders in the state, had one of its prominent
              representatives, Syed Muhammad of Amjhar sharif, based in the
              Aurangabad district of Bihar.
