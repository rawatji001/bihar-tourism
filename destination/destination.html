              Nalanda is about 90 km southeast of Patna. Although its history
              goes back to the times of the Buddha, the university at Nalanda
              was founded in the 5th century CE, and it flourished for the next
              700 years. Its decline began in the late Pala period, but the
              final blow was the invasion by Bakhtiyar Khilji around 1200 CE.
              The subjects that were taught at Nalanda included Buddhist
              scriptures (of both the Mahayana and Hinayana schools),
              philosophy, theology, metaphysics, logic, grammar, astronomy and
              medicine. Chinese travellers Hiuen-Tsang and I-Tsing had written
              detailed accounts about the university.

              this is one of the ancient Sun temples of the country. Reference

              texts. The 100 ft. high temple resembles the temple at Konark in
              its architectural form. A unique thing about the Deo temple is
              that it faces west unlike the traditional Sun temples which face
              east. Needless to say, Deo is the place where Chhath (Bihar’s most
              sacred festivals devoted to the Sun god) happens promptly. It is
              considered auspicious to visit the temple during Chhath, a

              when thousands of devotees perform arduous rituals over four days.
